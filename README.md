Days Ago Chrome Extension
==================================

A simple yet beautiful extension for Google Chrome which lets you manage upcoming dates. Simply type in the box on the "manage" screen:

    Book plane tickets in 5 days
    
A task `Book plane tickets` will be created in five days time.  To mark a task as finished just click it in the "manage" screen.

Currently if you type `daysago` and hit `tab` in the Chrome omnibox you can hit enter to open the extension.  In future this will 
allow you to create new tasks right from the omnibox.
